# Web Bank Application | WebApp
 
The Web Bank Web Application is a dynamic online banking system that enables customers to manage their bank accounts with ease. The application is built using JSP and Servlet technologies on the server-side and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client-side. It uses MySQL as the backend database to store customer data and transactions.

The main objective of the Web Bank Web Application is to provide customers with a user-friendly interface that allows them to perform a variety of banking operations including account creation, account deletion, balance checking, and money transfer. The application is designed to be secure and reliable, providing customers with a safe and convenient way to manage their finances.

The key features of the Web Bank Web Application are as follows:

 1. Account Creation: Customers can create their bank accounts by filling in a registration form with their personal information, including their name, email address,  and password.

 2. Account Deletion: Customers can delete their bank accounts by submitting a request through the application. The request will be processed by the backend system, and the account will be deleted from the database.

 3. Balance Checking: Customers can check their account balance by logging into the application and selecting the appropriate option from the main menu.

 4. Money Transfer: Customers can transfer money between their accounts or to other customers' accounts by selecting the appropriate option from the main menu and entering the required information.


The project will be divided into the following phases:

Requirements Analysis: This phase will involve gathering and documenting the requirements for the application.

Design: This phase will involve designing the application's user interface, database schema, and application architecture.

Development: This phase will involve coding the application's features, implementing the database schema, and integrating the front-end and back-end components.

Testing: This phase will involve testing the application's functionality, security, and performance.

Deployment: This phase will involve deploying the application to a production environment and performing final testing before releasing the application to the public.
